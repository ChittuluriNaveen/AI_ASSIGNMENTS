AI Search Puzzles
Python solutions for two classic state-space search problems.

1. Rabbit Leap Puzzle
Problem: Three rabbits on each side of a gap must cross to the other side using a line of stones. They can hop one step forward or jump over one other rabbit.

Solution: rabbit_problem.py uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the sequence of moves.

Run: python rabbit_problem.py

2. Bridge Crossing Problem
Problem: Four people must cross a bridge with only one umbrella within a 60-minute time limit. Each person has a different crossing speed, and the umbrella is required for every trip.

Solution: bridge_problem.py uses a shortest-path search algorithm to find the fastest sequence of crossings.

Run: python bridge_problem.py
